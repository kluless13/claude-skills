Based on: ["Every ambitious person must learn this skill"](https://letters.thedankoe.com/p/they-wont-teach-this-skill-in-school)

## The Core Insight

If you don't advertise your work, you will not earn money from that work. You already advertise unconsciously (job interviews, persuading friends, dating). Learning it consciously lets you get what you want ethically.

## When to Use

- User thinks marketing is sleazy
- User can't sell their work
- User asks about copywriting or persuasion
- User has skills but no income from them
- User resists self-promotion

## The 3 Foundations

1. **What big problem do you solve?**
2. **What desired outcome do you promise?**
3. **What's your unique mechanism?**

## Learning Path

1. Ca$hvertising (tactical foundation)
2. Flow + Breakthrough Advertising (deep psychology)
3. Any direct response copywriting course (practical)
4. AI to accelerate (reverse-engineer what works)

## Key Concepts

- **Historical truth**: Michelangelo, Shakespeare were great marketers
- **Natural selection**: Advertising is how value gets recognized
- **Combine learning**: Write about what you're learning (Protege Effect)
