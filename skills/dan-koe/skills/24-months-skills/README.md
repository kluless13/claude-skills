## The Core Insight

No skill is going to save you. The ability to learn any skill fast, however, will. The penalty for starting late is exponential, not linear.

## When to Use

- User asks what skills to learn
- User worried about AI taking jobs
- User wants to future-proof career
- User feels behind on technology
- User asks about adapting to change

## The 3 Types in Every Shift

| Type | Behavior | Outcome |
|------|----------|---------|
| Resisters | Attach identity to old ways | Get left behind |
| Waiters | Hope it blows over | Fall exponentially behind |
| Curious | Experiment and adapt | Thrive |

**Always be the curious one.**

## The Liberating Arts

Skills that free people have always needed:
- Logic, Statistics, Rhetoric, Research
- Psychology, Investment, Agency

These are capacities developed by doing things that demand them.

## The 3 Activities That Demand Everything

1. Build your own thing and put it in front of people
2. Write publicly, consistently
3. Use AI to do things you couldn't do before (not just avoid work)
