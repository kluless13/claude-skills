# How I'd Build a One-Person Business If I Started Over in 2026

From Dan Koe's article "How I'd build a one-person business if I started over in 2026"

## The Core Model

Solo founders with AI + digital leverage can now outcompete large teams.

The model:
- Build a personal monopoly at the intersection of your unique interests
- Use digital tools to create leverage
- Develop products that compound while you sleep
- Stack skills to solve bigger problems over time

## The Power Transfer

Three layers of power transfer have occurred:

### 1. The Internet (Knowledge)
- Access to any and all knowledge
- Power transferred from schools and institutions
- You can learn anything

### 2. Social Media (Leverage)
- Attract your own audience
- Power transferred from employers, publishers, centralized media
- Learn, build, and earn without depending on someone else's authority

### 3. Artificial Intelligence (Capability)
- Create, automate, and outsource almost anything
- Power transferring from traditional gatekeepers
- Operate at the level of large teams with fraction of manpower

**Result:** The individual can now pursue any interest or line of work.

## The Meta Model: Become a Creator

Not necessarily a "content creator" - but use creator tools to pursue your life's work.

Jordan Peterson example:
- Not a content creator per se
- But creates content because it's highest leverage for his mission
- Writes books, has academy, software, podcast, speaking
- Started with profession, amplified on internet
- Has meaningful mission, uses best tools available

## What You Can Build (Alone)

Thanks to technology, one person can build:

**Personal Media Company:**
- Blog
- Newsletter
- Podcast
- YouTube channel

**Education Platform:**
- Courses
- Coaching
- Communities

(People don't hate courses and coaches - they hate Level 1 courses and coaches that are scams)

**Software Products:**
- No-code tools
- AI assistance
- Or learn to code

**Physical Products:**
- Print-on-demand
- Dropshipping
- Small batch manufacturing

## The Digital Leverage Components

**Zero marginal cost distribution:**
Share with one person or one million for same effort

**Permissionless leverage:**
No gatekeepers required for audience access

**Compound growth:**
Content created once continues working while you sleep

**Global reach:**
Access to entire planet's population with wifi

**AI amplification:**
Tools that multiply creative output

**Direct monetization:**
Platforms enabling instant payment without intermediaries

## The Starting Point

Start with what you have:

**Pain point:** A problem you've solved for yourself
**Passion:** Something you genuinely care about
**Profession:** Skills developed in your job/career

You already have experience that can become independent income.

The best businesses emerge from:
- Problems you've personally solved
- Interests you can't stop thinking about
- Skills you've developed that others need

## The Path (If Starting Over)

### Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-6)

**Build in public:**
- Choose platform (Twitter/X, YouTube, etc.)
- Share what you're learning
- Document your journey
- Focus on quantity to find your voice

**Stack skills:**
- Writing (foundational)
- Marketing (essential)
- Product design (eventually)
- AI usage (accelerant)

**Find your positioning:**
- What unique combination do you bring?
- What transformation can you promise?
- Who is your past self that you can help?

### Phase 2: Audience (Months 6-12)

**Grow through value:**
- Consistent content
- Network with peers
- Add genuine value to conversations
- Build tribe of fellow travelers

**Test offers:**
- Free content → see what resonates
- Small paid products → test willingness to pay
- Services → validate with real clients

### Phase 3: Products (Months 12-24)

**Build product ecosystem:**
1. Free content (audience building)
2. Low-ticket product ($10-100) - proves concept
3. Mid-ticket product ($100-500) - scales income
4. High-ticket offer ($1000+) - for those who want more

**Iterate based on feedback:**
- What do people actually want?
- What questions keep coming up?
- What transformation can you guarantee?

## The Future of Products

Info products aren't dead. They're evolving.

**The evolution:**
- Pure information → Commoditized by AI
- Information + implementation → Still valuable
- Software-enhanced education → The future
- AI-assisted transformation → Where it's heading

**Build products that:**
- Solve real problems
- Include implementation support
- Use technology to enhance outcomes
- Create genuine transformation

## The One-Person Business Stack

**Content:** Newsletter, social media, YouTube (choose 1-2 to start)
**Community:** Discord, Skool, or similar (optional but powerful)
**Products:** Digital products, courses, coaching
**Software:** Tools that serve your audience (eventually)

## Key Principles

### 1. You Are the Niche
Your unique combination of interests, experiences, and perspective is the positioning. Stop trying to fit into someone else's box.

### 2. Mission Over Metrics
Lead people toward a transformation. Everything that moves toward that transformation becomes fair game for content and products.

### 3. Development Over Skill
Stack skills to solve bigger problems. Your income reflects the level of problems you can solve.

### 4. Energy Over Time
Money is energy. Build assets that create leverage. Don't trade time for money forever.

### 5. Quality Over Quantity
One person doing excellent work beats a team doing average work. AI amplifies your judgment and taste.

## Common Mistakes

**Starting with product before audience:**
Build audience first. Audience tells you what they need.

**Copying others' positioning:**
Your unique angle is your advantage. Find it.

**Avoiding the work:**
Everyone wants passive income. Build active income first.

**Over-complicating early:**
Simple offer → Simple audience → Simple content. Complexity comes later.

**Waiting to be "ready":**
You learn by doing. Start messy.

## The Long Game

This isn't get-rich-quick.

Timeline reality:
- Months 1-6: Learning, building, probably no money
- Months 6-12: Small wins, growing audience, some income
- Year 2: Sustainable income possible
- Year 3+: Compounding kicks in

The people who "make it" are the ones who didn't quit in year one.
