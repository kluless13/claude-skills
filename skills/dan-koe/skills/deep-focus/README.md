## The Focus Equation

**Focus = Clarity + Importance + Urgency**

All three must be present. Missing any one breaks focus.

## When to Use

- User can't concentrate
- User asks about deep work or productivity
- User struggles with distraction
- User wants to enter flow states
- User feels scattered or unfocused

## The Intrinsic Motivator Stack

Curiosity → Passion → Purpose → Autonomy → Mastery

Each level builds on the previous. You can't have mastery without autonomy, can't have autonomy without purpose, etc.

## The Fill/Empty/Use Cycle

| Mode | Activity | Example |
|------|----------|---------|
| Fill | Learning | Reading, consuming |
| Empty | Rest | Walking, sleeping |
| Use | Creating | Writing, building |

**The mistake**: Filling constantly without emptying or using.

## Key Concepts

- **Productivity block**: Know what to do, can't start → Make first step tiny
- **Creativity block**: Don't know what to do → Fill brain more
- **Flow requirements**: Clear goals + immediate feedback + challenge-skill balance
