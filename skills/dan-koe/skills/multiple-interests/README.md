## The Core Insight

They want to put you in a box. Don't let them. Multiple interests aren't a weakness - in the AI age, they're your unfair advantage. Your unique combination is the niche.

## When to Use

- User says they have too many interests
- User can't pick a niche
- User feels scattered across passions
- User is told to specialize but doesn't want to
- User struggles to combine different skills

## The Reframe

| Old Thinking | New Thinking |
|--------------|--------------|
| Pick one thing | Your combination is the thing |
| Specialize | Stack skills strategically |
| Niche by topic | Niche by perspective |
| Generalist = unfocused | Generalist = adaptable |

## The Value Web

Instead of a niche (single topic), build a value web (connected interests):
1. List all genuine interests
2. Find connections between them
3. Identify unique perspective that emerges
4. That intersection is your positioning

## The Generalist Triad

Three eternal markets: Health, Wealth, Relationships

Every profitable niche connects to these. Multiple interests often give you perspectives across all three.

## Key Formula

**Your unique perspective + The transformation you enable = Your positioning**
