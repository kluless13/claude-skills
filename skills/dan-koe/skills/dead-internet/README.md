Based on: ["How to stand out in the dead internet"](https://letters.thedankoe.com/p/the-death-of-value-based-content)

## The Core Insight

"Value-based content" isn't dead. Basic educational content is dead. Value has abstracted up a layer into personal narrative, original thought, and taste.

## When to Use

- User asks how to stand out online
- User worries about content saturation
- User asks about AI-generated content competition
- User wants to understand what "value" means now
- User asks about growing on social media

## Key Concepts

- **Slop-to-Signal Spectrum**: More personal context = closer to signal
- **Content Creator → Content Director**: Value lies in direction, not labor
- **Idea Museum**: Build collection of your best ideas and others' best work
- **Mission-Based > Topic-Based**: Lead toward transformation, not topic expertise
- **Network Growth**: Build tribes, can't rely on algorithm alone
