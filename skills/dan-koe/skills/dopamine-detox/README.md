## The Core Insight

Boredom is the gateway to novelty. When you eliminate cheap dopamine, your brain seeks reward elsewhere - that's when creativity, motivation, and natural curiosity return.

## When to Use

- User feels stuck or life has become a blur
- User can't focus or feels scattered
- User is addicted to phone/social media/gaming
- User wants to reset their habits
- User lacks motivation

## The 30-Day Protocol

| Phase | Days | Focus |
|-------|------|-------|
| Elimination | 1-7 | Remove cheap dopamine (social, gaming, junk food) |
| Replacement | 8-21 | High-effort activities (gym, reading, projects) |
| Integration | 22-30 | Selectively reintroduce, keep what serves |

## Key Concepts

- **Dopamine ≠ pleasure**: It's anticipation, drives toward rewards
- **Cheap vs earned dopamine**: Flow requires challenge-to-skill balance
- **The Project Requirement**: Must have meaningful work to channel energy
- **Environment > Willpower**: Remove temptations physically
