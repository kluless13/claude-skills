description: |
  Framework for articulating ideas intelligently in writing and speaking. Based on Dan Koe's methods.

  TRIGGERS:
  - When user asks to write a post, thread, or newsletter
  - When user is preparing for a podcast or presentation
  - When user wants to explain a complex idea
  - When user says "help me articulate" or "how do I explain"
  - When drafting content that needs to be compelling and clear

  CAPABILITIES:
  - Structure ideas using Problem-Amplify-Solution (beginner)
  - Apply Pyramid Principle for logical arguments (intermediate)
  - Cross-domain synthesis for unique perspectives (advanced)
  - Build "greatest hits" library of core ideas

# Articulation Framework

Help the user articulate ideas intelligently using these progressive methods.

## Core Principle: The Inner Album of Greatest Hits

Before writing or speaking, identify:
- What are the user's 8-10 biggest ideas?
- Which ideas have resonated most with their audience?
- What concepts can connect to almost any topic?

The best communicators don't answer questions directly - they speak their best idea on that topic with confidence, then expand with supporting points.

## Method Selection

| Complexity | Method | Use When |
|------------|--------|----------|
| Beginner | Micro Story | Quick posts, tweets, short explanations |
| Intermediate | Pyramid Principle | Arguments, recommendations, podcast answers |
| Advanced | Cross-Domain Synthesis | Newsletters, long-form, unique perspectives |

---

## Method 1: Micro Story (Beginner)

The mind is a story engine. Use transformation as the foundation.

**Structure:**
1. **Problem** - State a relatable problem observed or experienced
2. **Amplify** - Show negative outcome if unsolved (increases desire for solution)
3. **Solution** - State the solution (one sentence or short list)

**Example prompt to user:** "What problem does your audience face that relates to this idea?"

---

## Method 2: Pyramid Principle (Intermediate)

Answer-first, hierarchical structure.

**Structure:**
1. **Main idea** - Lead with key conclusion or recommendation
2. **Key arguments** - 3-5 supporting points (ask "why" 3-5 times)
3. **Evidence** - Data, examples, analysis for each argument

**Use for:** Podcast questions, meeting presentations, recommendations.

---

## Method 3: Cross-Domain Synthesis (Advanced)

For multi-interest creators who want unique angles.

**Structure:**
1. **Problem + Amplify** - Hook with relatable problem
2. **Cross-domain concept** - Import pattern from another field (physics, biology, psychology, etc.)
3. **Unique solution** - Steps from personal contemplation, not others' prescriptions

**Example:** Explaining deep work using entropy from physics to illustrate distraction.

## Idea Legos (Content Building Blocks)

When stuck filling sections, cycle through:

- **Pain point** - Start here, ideas flow naturally
- **Example** - Grounds the concept
- **Personal story** - Relatable time from your life
- **Statistic** - Adds authority
- **Metaphor** - Explain like talking to a child
- **Quote** - External justification
- **Reframe** - Different perspective on same point
- **What/How/Why** - When all else fails, just ask questions

---

## Workflow

1. **Identify the user's core idea** - What's the one thing they want to communicate?
2. **Select method** based on format and complexity
3. **Apply structure** - Walk through the framework step by step
4. **Add idea legos** - Fill gaps with examples, stories, stats
5. **Refine** - Ensure the "greatest hit" version is being used, not a new untested idea
