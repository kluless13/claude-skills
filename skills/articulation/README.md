# Articulation Skill

A Claude skill for articulating ideas intelligently in writing and speaking. Based on Dan Koe's frameworks.

## What It Does

This skill helps you structure and communicate ideas clearly using three progressive methods:

1. **Micro Story** (Beginner) - Problem → Amplify → Solution structure for quick posts and tweets
2. **Pyramid Principle** (Intermediate) - Answer-first, hierarchical arguments for podcasts and presentations
3. **Cross-Domain Synthesis** (Advanced) - Import concepts from other fields for unique long-form content

## When It Triggers

- Writing posts, threads, or newsletters
- Preparing for podcasts or presentations
- Explaining complex ideas
- Any content that needs to be compelling and clear

## Installation

1. Download the `articulation` folder
2. Add it to your Claude skills directory (`.skills/skills/`)
3. The skill will automatically trigger when relevant

## Core Concept: Greatest Hits

The skill is built around the idea that great communicators have 8-10 big ideas they've refined through repetition. Instead of inventing new ideas on the spot, they speak their best idea on any topic with confidence, then expand with supporting points.

## Idea Legos

When stuck, the skill helps you cycle through content building blocks:

- Pain point
- Example
- Personal story
- Statistic
- Metaphor
- Quote
- Reframe
- What/How/Why questions
